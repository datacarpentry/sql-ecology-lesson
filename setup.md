> ## Software
{: .prereq}
SQL is a specialized programming language used with databases.  We
use a simple database manager called [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/)
in our lessons.
    

We will use [SQLite Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/)
    plugin for the [Firefox web browser](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all/). If you don't have Firefox installed, you need to install it first and
    then you will be able to add the plugin.
    
Important note: The SQLite Manager plugin does not work with the latest versions of Firefox (v. 57 and later). If you need to download and install Firefox for this lesson, please install the Extended Service Release (ESR) version as described below. This version will be supported until mid-2018, at which point the SQLite Manager plugin will no longer be usable for this lesson. If you already have Firefox v. 57 or later installed on your machine, you will also need to download the ESR version in order to install the plugin.
