Databases are useful for both storing and using data effectively. Using a relational database serves several purposes.

- It keeps your data separate from your analysis. This means there's no risk of accidentally changing data when you analyze it.
- If we get new data we can rerun a query to find all the data that meets certain criteria.
- It's fast, even for large amounts of data.
- It improves quality control of data entry (type constraints and use of forms in Access, Filemaker, etc.)
- The concepts of relational database querying are core to understanding how to do similar things using programming languages such as R or Python.

This lesson will teach you what relational databases are, how you can load data
into them and how you can query databases to extract just the information that you need.
