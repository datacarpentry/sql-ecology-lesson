### Data

This lesson uses specific data files from the [Portal Project Teaching Database](https://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459). To
get the data, go to the [data location on figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459) and click on the **Download all** button to download the zip file.

If you are working on this lesson on your own, you can move the zipped data file to
anywhere on your computer where it is easy to access, and unzip the files. If you
are working on this lesson as part of a workshop, your instructor may advise you
to unzip the data files in a specific location.

See the
[Ecology Workshop Overview Page](https://datacarpentry.org/ecology-workshop/) for more details about the data set.

### Software

Download **DB Browser for SQLite** for your operating system
from [https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/).
**DB Browser for SQLite** is a visual tool to create, edit, and
query **SQLite** databases. **SQLite** is included with **DB Browser
for SQLite**, so it does not have to be installed separately.

- There are a few options for Windows, but most modern computers can use the `Standard installer for 64-bit Windows` version
  - The `.zip (no installer)` version can be run directly from the folder, after extracting the contents of the zip file. It will not show up in the `Start` menu.

Launch **DB Browser for SQLite** to confirm that the installation was successful.

### Am I ready?

The [first lesson episode](episodes/00-sql-introduction.md) has instructions
on loading the data in DB Browser. If you can follow the instructions under "Relational
Databases" or "Import", everything should have downloaded and installed correctly.
