::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Joins

To combine data from two tables we use an SQL `JOIN` clause, which comes after
the `FROM` clause.

Database tables are used to organize and group data by common characteristics or principles.  
Often, we need to combine elements from separate tables into a single tables or queries for analysis and visualization.
A JOIN is a means for combining columns from multiple tables by using values common to each.

The JOIN keyword combined with ON is used to combine fields from separate tables.

A `JOIN` clause on its own will result in a cross product, where each row in
the first table is paired with each row in the second table. Usually this is not
what is desired when combining two tables with data that is related in some way.

For that, we need to tell the computer which columns provide the link between the two
tables using the word `ON`.  What we want is to join the data with the same
species id.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM surveys
JOIN species
ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id;
```

`ON` is like `WHERE`. It filters things out according to a test condition.  We use
the `table.colname` format to tell the manager what column in which table we are
referring to.

The output from using the `JOIN` clause will have columns from the first table plus the
columns from the second table. For the above statement, the output will be a table
that has the following column names:

| record\_id | month                                                                           | day | year      | plot\_id  | species\_id | sex | hindfoot\_length | weight | species\_id | genus     | species  | taxa   | 
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --------- | -------- | ---------- | --- | --------------- | ------ | ---------- | --------- | -------- | ------ |
| ...       |                                                                                 |     |           |          |            |     |                 |        |            |           |          |        | 
| 96        | 8                                                                               | 20  | 1997      | 12       | **DM**           | M   | 36              | 41     | **DM**           | Dipodomys | merriami | Rodent | 
| ...       |                                                                                 |     |           |          |            |     |                 |        |            |           |          |        | 

Alternatively, we can use the word `USING`, as a short-hand. `USING` only
works on columns which share the same name. In this case we are
telling the manager that we want to combine `surveys` with `species` and that
the common column is `species_id`.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM surveys
JOIN species
USING (species_id);
```

The output will only have one **species\_id** column

| record\_id | month                                                                           | day | year      | plot\_id  | species\_id | sex | hindfoot\_length | weight | genus      | species   | taxa     | 
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --------- | -------- | ---------- | --- | --------------- | ------ | ---------- | --------- | -------- |
| ...       |                                                                                 |     |           |          |            |     |                 |        |            |           |          | 
| 96        | 8                                                                               | 20  | 1997      | 12       | DM         | M   | 36              | 41     | Dipodomys  | merriami  | Rodent   | 
| ...       |                                                                                 |     |           |          |            |     |                 |        |            |           |          | 

We often won't want all of the fields from both tables, so anywhere we would
have used a field name in a non-join query, we can use `table.colname`.

For example, what if we wanted information on when individuals of each
species were captured, but instead of their species ID we wanted their
actual species names.

```sql
SELECT surveys.year, surveys.month, surveys.day, species.genus, species.species
FROM surveys
JOIN species
ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id;
```

| year      | month                                                                           | day | genus     | species  | 
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- | --------- | -------- |
| ...       |                                                                                 |     |           |          | 
| 1977      | 7                                                                               | 16  | Neotoma   | albigula | 
| 1977      | 7                                                                               | 16  | Dipodomys | merriami | 
| ...       |                                                                                 |     |           |          | 

Many databases, including SQLite, also support a join through the `WHERE` clause of a query.  
For example, you may see the query above written without an explicit JOIN.

```sql
SELECT surveys.year, surveys.month, surveys.day, species.genus, species.species
FROM surveys, species
WHERE surveys.species_id = species.species_id;
```

For the remainder of this lesson, we'll stick with the explicit use of the `JOIN` keyword for
joining tables in SQL.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge:

- Write a query that returns the genus, the species name, and the weight
  of every individual captured at the site

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```sql
SELECT species.genus, species.species, surveys.weight
FROM surveys
JOIN species
ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id;
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### Different join types

We can count the number of records returned by our original join query.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM surveys
JOIN species
USING (species_id);
```

Notice that this number is smaller than the number of records present in the
survey data.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM surveys;
```

This is because, by default, SQL only returns records where the joining value
is present in the joined columns of both tables (i.e. it takes the *intersection*
of the two join columns). This joining behaviour is known as an `INNER JOIN`.
In fact the `JOIN` keyword is simply shorthand for `INNER JOIN` and the two
terms can be used interchangeably as they will produce the same result.

We can also tell the computer that we wish to keep all the records in the first
table by using a `LEFT OUTER JOIN` clause, or `LEFT JOIN` for short. The difference
between the two JOINs can be visualized like so:

![
Diagrams representing INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN in SQLite
](fig/sql-joins.png){
alt='Diagrams representing INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN each include two overlapping circles labeled A (left) and B (right). For INNER JOIN, the intersection of the two circles is filled in. The associated query is SELECT * FROM A JOIN B ON A.Key = B.Key. For LEFT JOIN, circle A, including its intersection with circle B, is filled in. The associated query is SELECT * FROM A LEFT JOIN B ON A.Key = B.Key.'
}

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge:

- Re-write the original query to keep all the entries present in the `surveys`
  table. How many records are returned by this query?

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```sql
SELECT * FROM surveys
LEFT JOIN species
USING (species_id);
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge:

- Count the number of records in the `surveys` table that have a `NULL` value
  in the `species_id` column.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM surveys
WHERE species_id IS NULL;
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Remember: In SQL a `NULL` value in one table can never be joined to a `NULL` value in a
second table because `NULL` is not equal to anything, not even itself.

### Combining joins with sorting and aggregation

Joins can be combined with sorting, filtering, and aggregation. So, if we
wanted average mass of the individuals on each different type of treatment, we
could do something like

```sql
SELECT plots.plot_type, AVG(surveys.weight)
FROM surveys
JOIN plots
ON surveys.plot_id = plots.plot_id
GROUP BY plots.plot_type;
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge:

- Write a query that returns the number of animals caught of each genus in each plot.
  Order the results by plot number (ascending) and by descending number of individuals in each plot.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```sql
SELECT surveys.plot_id, species.genus, COUNT(*) AS number_indiv
FROM surveys
JOIN species
ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id
GROUP BY species.genus, surveys.plot_id
ORDER BY surveys.plot_id ASC, number_indiv DESC;
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge:

- Write a query that finds the average weight of each rodent species (i.e., only include species with Rodent in the taxa field).

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```sql
SELECT surveys.species_id, AVG(surveys.weight)
FROM surveys
JOIN species
ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id
WHERE species.taxa = 'Rodent'
GROUP BY surveys.species_id;
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Functions `COALESCE` and `NULLIF` and more

SQL includes numerous functions for manipulating data. You've already seen some
of these being used for aggregation (`SUM` and `COUNT`) but there are functions
that operate on individual values as well. Probably the most important of these
are `COALESCE` and `NULLIF`. `COALESCE` allows us to specify a value to use in
place of `NULL`.

We can represent unknown sexes with `'U'` instead of `NULL`:

```sql
SELECT species_id, sex, COALESCE(sex, 'U')
FROM surveys;
```

The lone "sex" column is only included in the query above to illustrate where
`COALESCE` has changed values; this isn't a usage requirement.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge:

- Write a query that returns 30 instead of `NULL` for values in the
  `hindfoot_length` column.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```sql
SELECT hindfoot_length, COALESCE(hindfoot_length, 30)
FROM surveys;
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge:

- Write a query that calculates the average hind-foot length of each species,
  assuming that unknown lengths are 30 (as above).

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```sql
SELECT species_id, AVG(COALESCE(hindfoot_length, 30))
FROM surveys
GROUP BY species_id;
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

`COALESCE` can be particularly useful in `JOIN`. When joining the `species` and
`surveys` tables earlier, some results were excluded because the `species_id`
was `NULL` in the surveys table. We can use `COALESCE` to include them again, re-writing the `NULL` to
a valid joining value:

```sql
SELECT surveys.year, surveys.month, surveys.day, species.genus, species.species
FROM surveys
JOIN species
ON COALESCE(surveys.species_id, 'AB') = species.species_id;
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge:

- Write a query that returns the number of animals caught of each genus in each
  plot, assuming that unknown species are all of the genus "Rodent".

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

```sql
SELECT plot_id, COALESCE(genus, 'Rodent') AS genus2, COUNT(*)
FROM surveys 
LEFT JOIN species
ON surveys.species_id=species.species_id
GROUP BY plot_id, genus2;
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The inverse of `COALESCE` is `NULLIF`. This returns `NULL` if the first argument
is equal to the second argument. If the two are not equal, the first argument
is returned. This is useful for "nulling out" specific values.

We can "null out" plot 7:

```sql
SELECT species_id, plot_id, NULLIF(plot_id, 7)
FROM surveys;
```

Some more functions which are common to SQL databases are listed in the table
below:

| Function  | Description                                                                     |

| `LOWER(s)`          | Returns the string expression *s* converted to lowercase                                                  | 
| `NULLIF(x, y)`          | Returns NULL if *x* is equal to *y*, otherwise returns *x*                                                                | 
| `ROUND(n)` or `ROUND(n, x)`      | Returns the numeric expression *n* rounded to *x* digits after the decimal point (0 by default)                                                 | 
| `TRIM(s)`          | Returns the string expression *s* without leading and trailing whitespace characters                                                  | 
| `UPPER(s)`          | Returns the string expression *s* converted to uppercase                                                  | 

Finally, some useful functions which are particular to SQLite are listed in the
table below:

| Function  | Description                                                                     |

## Challenge:

Write a query that returns genus names (no repeats), sorted from longest genus name down
to shortest.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

As we saw before, aliases make things clearer, and are especially useful when joining tables.

```sql
SELECT surv.year AS yr, surv.month AS mo, surv.day AS day, sp.genus AS gen, sp.species AS sp
FROM surveys AS surv
JOIN species AS sp
ON surv.species_id = sp.species_id;
```

To practice we have some optional challenges for you.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Challenge (optional):

SQL queries help us *ask* specific *questions* which we want to answer about our data. The real skill with SQL is to know how to translate our scientific questions into a sensible SQL query (and subsequently visualize and interpret our results).

Have a look at the following questions; these questions are written in plain English. Can you translate them to *SQL queries* and give a suitable answer?

1. How many plots from each type are there?

2. How many specimens are of each sex are there for each year, including those whose sex is unknown?

3. How many specimens of each species were captured in each type of plot, excluding specimens of unknown species?

4. What is the average weight of each taxa?

5. What are the minimum, maximum and average weight for each species of Rodent?

6. What is the average hindfoot length for male and female rodent of each species? Is there a Male / Female difference?

7. What is the average weight of each rodent species over the course of the years? Is there any noticeable trend for any of the species?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Use a `JOIN` clause to combine data from two tables---the `ON` or `USING` keywords specify which columns link the tables.
- Regular `JOIN` returns only matching rows. Other join clauses provide different behavior, e.g., `LEFT JOIN` retains all rows of the table on the left side of the clause.
- `COALESCE` allows you to specify a value to use in place of `NULL`, which can help in joins
- `NULLIF` can be used to replace certain values with `NULL` in results
- Many other functions like `COALESCE` and `NULLIF` can operate on individual values.
